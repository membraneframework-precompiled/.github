# Membrane Framework Precompiled

This organization serves a purpose of hosting precompiled builds of packages and libraries required by [Membrane](https://github.com/membraneframework) plugins. These builds are generated by installing packages with [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) on different CircleCI execution environments.

## Adding New Precompiled Builds

If you want to add a new package repository using the automated method (homebrew on CircleCI), follow these steps:

1. Ensure the package is available in homebrew by running `brew info <package>` or check at `https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/<package>`

2. Create a repository named `precompiled_<package>` (for instance, `precompiled_portaudio`) from the `precompiled_template` template.

3. In the `.circleci/config.yml` file, replace `PACKAGE_NAME_HERE` with the package name (the same one that was used in the repository name).

To initiate the precompilation process, push a tag matching the latest version of your package, prefixed with 'v'. You can check the latest version of the package by running `brew info <package>` or visiting `https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/<package>`. For example, to trigger the precompilation of a package with a latest version of 1.2.3, you would need to push a `v1.2.3` tag. Once the CircleCI pipeline finishes the precompilation and publishing process, a new release will be created from the pushed tag that contains the precompiled builds of the package.
